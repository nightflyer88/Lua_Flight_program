# LUA Flight program

Flight program training app. Each flight figure is announced by the app, it is therefore not necessary to look at the transmitter. An optional background music can also be played.


## Create flight program

For each flight figure, an audio announcement must first be made. These audio files may e.g. created here: https://www.rc-thoughts.com/tts/
Then copy the voice files (* .WAV) to the transmitter in the audio folder. An optional background music (mp3 format) must be in the Music folder.

The flight program can now be put together comfortably in the app with the audio files and break times. So that the pauses between the voice announcements can be determined more easily, the program sequence can be set to "teach in time". Now during the flight with the start button to the next flight figure switch and the app automatically saves the break times. Then the program sequence can be set to "Auto" again. If necessary, the break times can be manually optimized.


## Copy flight program

Just rename the flight program and the app will automatically make a copy of it.


## Delete flight program

Is only possible by computer. The apps/flightProg/prog folder contains the flight programs.
